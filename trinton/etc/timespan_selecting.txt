A replacement for the process of using measure indices to select components to replace after rhythm making (group_by_measure can't handle measure crossing tuplets which produce leafless measures)

1. Any score component can be queried for a timespan which represents the context of its contiguous logical voice (abjad.get.timespan)

2. The global context will never have giant tuplets (the voice might)

3. We can select the relevant measures by index using the global context consistently

4. Ask the skips in the global context for their timespans and save a new timespan which is their sum (grab the first one's start_offset and the last one's stop_offset)

5. Timespans can be compared. (intersects_timespan ?)

6. Create list of leaves in voice which intersect timespan

7. After done iterating all leaves in voice, replace list of leaves with new selections.
